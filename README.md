# Analyze_Death_Age_Difference_of_Right_Handers_with_Left_Handers
This innovative research endeavor seeks to verify the long-held notion that left-handed individuals live shortened lives. There is a paucity of scientific evidence to support this claim, despite the fact that anecdotal claims have persisted for centuries.

This extensive project will employ rigorous methodologies, such as large-scale population studies, statistical analysis, and genetic investigations, to investigate the putative relationship between left-handedness and premature mortality. This initiative aims to provide empirical evidence to either corroborate or refute this widely held belief by analyzing disparate populations across various demographics and geographic areas.
